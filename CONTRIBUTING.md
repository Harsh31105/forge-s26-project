# Contributing

## Overview

To submit any new changes to the code, create a pull request using the provided template. Make sure
provide a descriptive title to the template and if applicable, link the associated issue with it. 

## Backend PRs

If you're writing backend code, please include a screenshot of your endpoint(s) working through
manual testing (Postman, etc.). 
Please also include URL + parameters you passed in for the calls so that's visible and easy for someone
to replicate those tests, if and when needed! 

## Frontend PRs

If you're writing frontend code, please include a screenshot or screen recording of your updates! 

## Review process

Once a pull request has been submitted, make sure to mark your project lead as one
of the reviewers of the PR and if there's other team members that have worked on sections of the 
code you've edited in places, feel free to also request a code review from them as well. 

**Tip:** You can open a *draft PR* to run CI checks before officially submitting your PR for review. 
This also provides space for your team to have very real updates of your work throughout the week. 

If your pull request is reviewed and not approved, the reviewer will leave some suggestions for changes. (Sometimes we will approve and still leave suggestions). 
Once changes are made, please ask for a re-review and if more conversation is needed on the comments, 
feel free to also reach out to your PL through Slack!
